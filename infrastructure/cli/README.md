Manage my prison â€“ CLI
======================

Command line shortcuts for common tasks, particularly those related to infrastructure hosted in Cloud Platform or AWS.
They do not form part of the built/deployed application.

The current working directory needs to be `/infrastructure/cli`, commands cannot be run from the project root.

See `./index.ts --help` for list of commands;
they are nested by theme so `./index.ts ecr --help` for example lists commands to do with AWS ECR.
